    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>Believe it or not, this meal is for you. You, too, can make sushi at home! 
    <strong>Veggie sushi rolls</strong> are now easier than ever with just about any basic at-home sushi kit from Amazon! </p>
    <p>With healthy vegetables, you can have a full plate of sushi rolls in 30 minutes or less without <em>half the expense</em> of going out to eat. 
    Follow the recipe below to get started.</p>
    <h4>Ingredients</h4>
    <ul>
        
        <li>1 cup sushi rice (this can be found at any Asian mart)</li>
        <li>A drizzle of rice vinegar</li>
        <li>1 cucumber</li> 
        <li>1 carrot</li>
        <li>1 avocado</li>
        <li>2 sheets of nori</li>
        <li>Spicy mayo for plating</li>
        <li>A pinch of sesame seeds</li>
        <li>2 cups of white vinegar</li>
        <li>1 cup of water</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons of sugar</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Directions</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Combine white vinegar, water, and sugar into a pot, then bring to a boil.</li>
        <li>Peel carrot into thin strips. Once finished, shove carrots into a mason jar.
            After the water has come to a boil, pour into the mason jar with the carrots
            and let it sit until it cools down to room temperature.
            This will give you pickled carrots!</li>
        <li>Clean rice and add to rice cooker (if you don't have a rice cooker,
            find another recipe because you shouldn't be making this).</li>
        <li>Cut cucumber into batons. The batons should be as wide as the nori.</li>
        <li>Cut avocado into strips.</li>
        <li>Check on your rice. If it is ready, spread it out on a baking sheet,
            cover with rice vinegar, stir to coat, then place in the freezer until cool.</li>
        <li>Drain your carrots once they have cooled down.</li>
        <li>Once your rice is cool and your avocado, carrot, and cucumber is prepared, bring them to a staging area.</li>
        <li>From there, line your sushi bazooka (again, get this before you start this recipe - 
            sorry if you're reading this too late. Your fault) with rice. 
            You will need to wet your hands. I recommend having a spare bowl with water in the staging area. 
            Create a dimple in the rice to place fillings.</li>
        <li>Add the appropriate amount of cucumber, carrot, and avocado for your liking. 
            Close the sushi bazooka, compress the sushi, and push it out onto a sheet of nori.</li>
        <li>Roll the sushi in the nori, cut into thin strips, then drizzle with spicy mayo and sesame seeds.</li>
        <li>Repeat until all the ingredients are gone.</li>
        <li>You should now have at least 2 homemade veggie sushi rolls! Tanoshimu.</li>
    </ol>
