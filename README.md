This project includes several lessons learned about basical HTML syntax.
You will see hyperlinked recipe pages. Each of these pages open to new tabs, utilizing the "target=_blank" code.
The code for each of these recipes use <em> and <strong> tags.
It's a pretty simple project. Click on the links, and enjoy a couple of my favorite recipes!
